## Bike Sharing Assignment

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

This assignment is done to analyse & understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
The company wants to know:

 - **Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.**
